/**
 * <p>This implements the core functionality for all inverted list readers. It
 * can also be used as a read-only TreeMap for disk-based data structures. In
 * Galago, it is used both to store index data and to store documents.</p>
 *
 * <p>An index is a mapping from String to byte[]. If compression is turned on,
 * the value must be small enough that it fits in memory. If compression is off,
 * values are streamed directly from disk so there is no size restriction.
 * Indexes support iteration over all keys, or direct lookup of a single key.
 * The structure is optimized to support fast random lookup on disks.</p>
 *
 * <p>Data is stored in blocks, typically 32K each. Each block has a
 * prefix-compressed set of keys at the beginning, followed by a block of value
 * data. </p>
 *
 * <p>Typically this class is extended by composition instead of
 * inheritance.</p>
 *
 * <p> (11/29/2010, irmarc): After conferral with Sam, going to remove the
 * requirement that keys be Strings. It makes the mapping from other
 * classes/primitives to Strings really restrictive if they always have to be
 * mapped to Strings. Therefore, mapping byte[] keys to the client keyspace is
 * the responsibility of the client of the DiskBTreeReader.</p>
